				<h1>Taking A Break From What You Are Doing</h1>
				<h5>BY MADISYN TAYLOR</h5>
				<div class="para-wid absolute"><span>Sometimes finding the answer is as easy as taking a break and stepping back from the situation.<span class="para-hide">Sometimes we can get so wrapped up in our thoughts that we wind up going round in round in circles, finding it difficult to concentrate on things and, because we are so distracted, not really accomplishing much. </span><span  class="hide">There may be signals--mental, emotional, and physical--that tell us we need to slow down and relax. Since we are so involved in things that are external to us, however, we may easily overlook what is really going on inside of us. It is during these times that we need to step back from the things that occupy our minds and take time out to connect with our inner self, giving our minds, bodies, and spirits the time they need to reenergize and heal.</span></span></div>

					<p class="para-wid1">Meditation is relaxation. It is not about concentration, it’s actually about de-concentration. It’s not about focussing one’s thoughts on something specific, but instead of entering a state of mind that has no thoughts. The overall benefits of meditations include a calm mind, enhanced concentration, improved clarity and communication, and relaxation of the mind and body. Regular practice of meditation has a profound impact on the core three areas of our existence - physical, mental, and spiritual.Several studies emphasize the importance of a regular meditation habit. In fact, many consider meditation to be a necessity in today’s busy times. Many successful, healthy people don’t think they need meditation.</p>
